# Openpilot Custom Student Project

This repo contains ONLY:
- Dataset preparation guide (docs/)
- Two openpilot files students will copy into their own openpilot checkout

## How to use
1) Clone openpilot (upstream) separately.
2) Copy files from `openpilot_files/` into your openpilot directory, preserving paths.
3) Follow `docs/DATA_PREPARATION_GUIDE.md` for replay → capture → optional offline labeling (YOLO + Depth).
